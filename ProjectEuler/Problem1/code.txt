/* 
Problem 1:
	If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

	Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

/* Explanation (read bottom up.)

	3 5
	{+⌿⍸	 // coverts the resulting boolean mask to their ordinal value and sums them together.
	∨⌿0= // Takes that matrix and creates a boolean matrix of each multiple of ⍺ as 1, and performs an or-wise reduction on the matrix to create a vector of all multiples of the elements of ⍺
	⍺∘.|⍳⍵} // Creates a matrix of remainders of each ⍺ for 1 to ⍵ of shape ⍺×⍵.
