Problem 4:
	A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 × 99.

	Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

//Code:
{⌈/⍵/⍨(⌽≡⊢)¨(10⊥⍣¯1⊢)¨⍵}∪∊∘.×⍨99↓⍳999

/* Explanation: (bottom up)
{⌈/⍵/⍨ 			// Reduce the vector of product by the boolean vector and find the maximum scalar
(⌽≡⊢)¨ 		// And find if each vector is equivalent to its reverse and generate a boolean vector
(10⊥⍣¯1⊢)¨⍵}  // Turn each scalar product into a vector of its digits (magic inverse, yay!)
∪∊∘.×⍨ 		   // Generate a vector of all unique products in this range
99↓⍳999 		   // For 100 to 999:
