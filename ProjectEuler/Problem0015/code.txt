/*
Problem 15
	Starting in the top left corner of a 2×2 grid, and only being able to move to the right and down, there are exactly 6 routes to the bottom right corner.
	How many such routes are there through a 20×20 grid?
*/

//Code
{((⌈2÷⍨≢)⊃⊢)∊¯1↑⍉∘.!⍨0,⍳⍵×2}20

/* Explanation:

{((⌈2÷⍨≢)⊃⊢)∊  // Since this term will always be an odd length, and we want the middle term, divide the length by two and round up and extract that value from the vector.
¯1↑⍉		    // Extracts the ⍵th term,
⍉∘.!⍨0,⍳⍵×2}    // Generates a pascal triangle ⍵*2 terms high
20
